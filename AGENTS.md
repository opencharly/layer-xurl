# AGENTS.md — layer-xurl

Standalone candy repo for the `xurl` layer — the X (Twitter) API CLI, installed
globally via npm with an explicit postinstall. The candy lives in `charly.yml` at
the repo root: the `require:` on `layer-nodejs`, the postinstall `run:` step, the
`check:` assertions, and the embedded `skill:` entity projected into the
marketplace corpus as `/charly-tools:xurl`. The npm package is pinned in
`package.json`.

Canonical files:

- `charly.yml` — the `xurl:` candy entity and the `xurl-skill:` skill entity.
- `package.json` — pins the `@xdevplatform/xurl` npm package.
- `CHANGELOG/` — per-CalVer release history.
- `.github/workflows/tag-on-merge.yml` — CalVer tag + `CHANGELOG/` on merge.
- `README.md` — user overview only; never agent guidance.

## Load these skills first (R0)

- `/charly-tools:xurl` — the owning skill. The npm-global install path, the
  postinstall-binary workaround, and the CLI surface. Load before editing or
  troubleshooting the layer.
- `/charly-image:layer` — the candy authoring reference (`charly.yml` schema,
  `plan:` step verbs incl. `check:`, per-distro `distro:` arms, package/repo
  sections, service declarations). Load before editing any entity field or plan
  step.

## Build / validate / test

- The merge gate is the **org-wide** `charly/pr-validator` (required check
  `validate / validate`, defined in `opencharly/.github`); this repo has **no
  per-repo candy gate** and ships only `.github/workflows/tag-on-merge.yml`.
- The candy's `plan:` `check:` steps are the functional evidence — the binary in
  the npm global bin and `xurl --help`.
- The explicit `install.js` run is load-bearing: npm ≥12 blocks the package's
  postinstall by default, so without it the platform binary is never fetched.
  Keep it in step with the package layout.

## Modify this repo

- Edit the `xurl:` candy entity AND the `xurl-skill:` skill entity in
  `charly.yml` together. The skill is the projected usage source, so a behaviour
  change not mirrored in the skill leaves the corpus stale.
- The npm package pin lives in `package.json`; keep it and the `check:`
  assertions in sync.
- New behaviour claims belong in the `plan:` as an observable `check:` step, and
  in the skill body.

## Landing

- PR-only. Every change lands through a pull request; the org-required
  `charly/pr-validator` validates the diff and body and arms native auto-merge on
  PASS. Direct pushes to `main` are blocked.
- History lives in `CHANGELOG/` (written by `tag-on-merge` at merge time); the PR
  body IS the changelog.
- The authoritative rulebook is the umbrella `AGENTS.md` in
  `opencharly/opencharly` and `charly/AGENTS.md` in the charly repo. Do not
  restate its rules here.
